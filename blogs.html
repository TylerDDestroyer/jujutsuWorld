      <h4>Yuji's Power up</h4>
      <p>Yuji Itadori is the protagonist of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen. Fans know him 
        to be an incredible character who joins Tokyo Jujutsu High in the very beginning 
        and becomes a sorcerer due to the circumstances that he is put into. Yuji's mission 
        is to find Sukuna's fingers and consume them and, in doing so, he heads out on an 
        incredible journey where he makes many friends and loses quite a lot of others as well.
         Jujutsu Sorcery is, of course, at the center of this story and nearly every powerful
          character in JJK has a cursed technique.
        However, Yuji's case is quite unique. While he is quite strong at this point in the 
        story, he doesn't possess any cursed technique. He can use cursed energy incredibly 
        efficiently, however, when it comes to the usage of a cursed technique, Yuji doesn't 
        have one at all. That certainly doesn't mean that he can't manifest one in the story. 
        There have been hints about him manifesting a powerful cursed technique throughout the 
        story and, perhaps, now is the time for him to showcase this power.</p>

      <h4>Gojo Satoru's Revival</h4>
      <p>Gojo Satoru is an exceptionally important character in JJK and one could go
         as far as to say that he is the face of the entire series. He's one of the fan 
         favorites in the story and certainly a character who has had a profound effect 
         on many fans. Unfortunately, the fans lost a beloved character when Gojo was unsealed
          in the Culling Game arc.
        To answer how Gojo can come back to life using a Binding Vow, one must 
        first explain why Gojo needs to come back to the story in the first place.
         There are many compelling reasons for Gojo to return and, while it isn't set in stone, 
         it is something that should ideally happen. There are too many storylines around Gojo that 
         need to be resolved with him present in the story. That is not to say that the story cannot
          continue or conclude if Gojo does not return. The author could very well choose to simply 
          kill off Gojo for good and never bring him back to the story, however, doing so would reduce
           Gojo to a very badly handled character.</p>
